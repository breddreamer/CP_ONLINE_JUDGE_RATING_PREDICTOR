## Project Idea
Online judge programming contest rating prediction.
### Motivation
Online programming contest is now a days is a very trending topic today. Every contestant in a rated contest is very optimist to have positive rating changes. If a contestant get a predicted rating change before the contest, that may help him to improve in their rating. Our work is to help on that scope by predicting a rating change for individual contestant in a specific contest. 
### Scope
We initilally tried our model only for codeforces, but it can be used for other online judges too by understanding the idea and documentation of our project.
### Platform
This is a web application. We wrote our model on jupyter notebook, because its a convenient one for ML/AI projects. Here we got our results on console only. Then we added frontend-ish look with voila. Voila enabled our model to work as an interactive web app, where user will be able to give input and model will calculate output based on our implementation.
### Project Brief
User will give input as a handle of codeforces contestant. The model will predict upcoming contest rating of the contestant and show the result.
